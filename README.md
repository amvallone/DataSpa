# DataSpa

This package contains a set of functions, which extract and organize databases at the municipality level (LAU, former NUTS 5) in Spain on population, unemployment, vehicle fleets and firms.

We have no intentions in the short run to upload the package to the CRAN. The package 'devtools' is required to install the package

```r{output="html"}
devtools::install_github("amvallone/DataSpa")
```
The package is still on a development stage. Please, feel free to contribute to improving it. In case of errors, please, open a new issue.
