# DataSpa

This package contains a set of functions to extract and organize databases at the municipality level (NUTS 5) in Spain on population, unemployment, vehicle fleet and firms.

There is no intentions in the short run to upload the package to the CRAN. The package 'devtools' is required to install the package.

```r{output="html"}
devtools::install_github("amvallone/DataSpa")
```
The package is still on development stage. Please, feel free to contribute to improving it. In case of errors, please, open a new issue.
